DE001AssetInformation,Enrichment Data,"Creating or having access to a  robust asset inventory is a foundational activity because it is critical for  a security team to know what it is defending before there can be any hope of  securing it. Indeed, many attackers succeed because they have a deeper  understanding of the target environment than the teams who are tasked with  defending them thus increasing their attack surface. The Assets and  Identities framework in Splunk Enterprise Security provides a simple yet very  useful way to store asset data and correlate it with activity observed across  the environment. An asset for the purpose of security monitoring is an  authorized presence on the internal network which may be identified as a  source or destination network address by IP address, MAC address, hostname,  or fully qualified domain name."
DE002IdentityInformation,Enrichment Data,An identity (for the purpose of  security monitoring) is an authorized or previously authorized presence on  the network which may be identified as a source or destination account.  Multiple records are grouped together by account to identify one human identity  or nonhuman application.
DE003ThreatIntelligence,Enrichment Data,"Threat Intelligence, a large  blanket term for numerous types of threat data, can be a useful reference to  know what external sources think of a particular IP address, file name, file  hash, domain name, SSL Certificate, or the like. Expand this section."
DS001MAIL,Data Source,"Email remains the primary form  of formal communication in most organizations. As such, mail server databases  and logs are some of the most important business records. Email messages and  activity logs can be required to maintain compliance with an organization's  information security, retention, and regulatory compliance processes, and may  be subpoenaed or legally held as part of civil or criminal investigations."
DS002DNS,Data Source,"The domain name system (DNS) is  the Internet's phone book, providing a mapping between system or network  resource names and IP addresses. DNS has a hierarchical name space that  typically includes three levels: a top-level domain (TLD) such as .com, .edu or  .gov; a second-level domain such as ""google"" or  ""Whitehouse;"" and a system level such as ""www"" or  ""mail."" DNS nameservers operate in this hierarchy either by acting  as authoritative sources for particular domains, such as a company or  governme"
DS003Authentication,Data Source,Authentication systems  establish the identity of an actor using one or more secret values i.e.  password and one time pin. The authentication system typically issues a new  secret which can be provided to applications i.e. Kerberos token or web  cookie to permit access to a secured resource.
DS004EndPointAntiMalware,Data Source,"The weakest link in corporate  security are individuals, and antivirus is one way to protect them from  performing inadvertently harmful actions. Whether it is clicking on an  untrustworthy web link, downloading malicious software or opening a  booby-trapped document (often one sent to them by an unsuspecting colleague),  antivirus can often prevent, mitigate or reverse the damage."
DS005WebProxyRequest,Data Source,"Web Proxies and some next  generation firewalls may act in transparent or explicit mode communicating  with (s) servers on behalf of a client. Using a number of related  technologies the request and response can and permitted or blocked based on  users role, site or resource category or attack indicator. Data logged in the  events can potentially be used in detective correlation."
DS006UserActivity,Data Source,"User activity within the  organization environment such as Create Read(display), update, delete, search  events must include critical data such as action, result, app, and a locator  uri allowing normalized search on the targets of activity."
DS007AuditTrail,Data Source,Audit trail events represent a  special class of events which can be triggered based on automated or user  interaction with systems and indicate a condition has occurred where the  integrity of the source is suspect at a point in time.
DS008IdentityAndAccount,Data Source,"Master Data system for Human  Resources may publish an event indicating critical changes impacting people  in an organization. Human Resources records include the entire employee  lifecycle including recruitment, selection, hiring, job position and classification,  promotion, salary, and bonuses, performance and ratings, disciplinary  actions, training and certifications, and separation or retirement. For  hourly employees, HR data often includes time and attendance records. HR  systems often feed payr"
DS009EndPointIntel,Data Source,"In this context, endpoint  refers to the security client software or agent installed on a client device  that logs security-related activity not otherwise generated by the host  operating system from the client OS, login, logout, shutdown events and  various applications such as the browser (Explorer, Edge), mail client  (Outlook) and Office applications. Endpoints also log their configuration and  various security parameters (certificates, local anti-malware signatures,  etc.), all of which is useful"
DS010NetworkCommunication,Data Source,"Network communication data is a  record of communication between two system commonly using TCP version 4 or  TCP version 6. Network communication can be recorded by a number of  technologies including host operating systems, firewalls, switches, routers,  deep packet inspection, and intrusion detection systems."
DS011MalwareDetonation,Data Source,Malware detonation systems also  are known as sandboxing systems execute potentially malicious code in a clean  environment for the purpose of collecting events related to their actions.  Using automated and manual analysis indicators can be determined which can  inform additional breach detection and prevention capability
DS012NetworkIntrusionDetection,Data Source,"What is Intrusion  Detection/Prevention? IDS and IPS are complementary, parallel security  systems that supplement firewalls – IDS by exposing successful network and  server attacks that penetrate a firewall, and IPS by providing more advanced  defenses against sophisticated attacks. IDS is typically placed at the  network edge, just inside a perimeter firewall, although some organizations  also put a system outside the firewall to provide greater intelligence about  all attacks. Likewise, IPS is typic"
DS013TicketManagement,Data Source,"Ticket management from tracking  systems responsible for the security, and operational health of the  environment(s) provides a rich resource for evaluating the effectiveness of  the security program, as well as the detective, and preventive controls in  place."
DS014WebServer,Data Source,"Web server logs allow  attribution of activity to a specific source ip and user when authenticated.  The logs are detailed records of every transaction: every time a browser  requests a web page, Apache logs details include items such as the time,  remote IP address, browser type and page requested. Web Servers also log  various error conditions such as a request for a missing file, attempts to  access a file without appropriate permissions or problems with extension  modules. Web Server logs are criti"
DS015ConfigurationManagement,Data Source,"Configuration management  solution such as VMware Vcenter, MAAS, Puppet, Chef, System Center  Configuration Manager, and System Center Virtualization Manager. Events  generated by these systems can provide valuable security investigations by  providing information about who and what changes have been applied to  systems. Additional information such as the base image utilized, birth and  death timestamps provide data useful to identify windows of vulnerability."
DS016DataLossPrevention,Data Source,Data loss prevention solutions  can identify human and automated activities as they interact with restricted  information creating an audit trail of attempted actions and the systems  response such as allow or block.
DS017PhysicalSecurity,Data Source,"Most organizations use  automated systems to secure physical access to facilities. Historically,  these have been simple magnetic strips affixed to employee badges; however,  locations with stringent security requirements may use some form of  a biometric reader or digital key. Regardless of the technology, the  systems compare an individual's identity with a database and activate doors  when the user is authorized to enter a particular location. As digital  systems, badge readers record information su"
DS018VulnerabilityDetection,Data Source,"An effective way to find  security holes is to examine one's infrastructure from the attacker's point  of view. Vulnerability scans probe an organization's network for known  software defects that provide entry points for external agents. The scans  yield data about open ports and IP addresses that can be used by malicious  agents to gain entry to a particular system or entire network. Systems often  keep network services running by default, even when they aren't required for  a particular server. The"
DS019PatchManagement,Data Source,"Keeping operating systems and  applications updated with the latest bug fixes and security patches is an  essential task that can prevent unplanned downtime, random application  crashes and security breaches. Although commercial apps and OSs often have  embedded patching software, some organizations use independent patch  management software to consolidate patch management and ensure the consistent  application of patches across their software fleet and to build patch jobs  for custom, internal applic"
DS020HostIntrustionDetection,Data Source,Host based Intrusion Detection  events provide signature based detection of changes that could weaken the  security posture of the host based on changes to entire files or specific  configuration. Such data can be very valuable in identifying when critical changes  have occurred in the environment.
DS021Telephony,Data Source,"Real-time business  communications no longer are limited to voice calls provided by Plain Old  Telephone Service (POTS); instead, voice, video, text messaging and web  conferences are IP applications delivered over existing enterprise networks.  Unlike traditional client-server or web applications, telephony and other  communications applications have strict requirements on network quality of  service, latency and packet loss, making service quality and reliability much  more sensitive to network condi"
DS022Performance,Data Source,"Measures of system activity  such as CPU load, memory and disk usage, and I/O traffic are the IT  equivalent of EKGs to a doctor: the vital signs that show system health.  Recording these measures provides a record of system activity over time that  shows normal, baseline levels and unusual events. By registering myriad  system parameters, performance logs also can highlight mismatches between  system capacity and application requirements, such as a database using all  available system memory and frequ"
DS023CrashReporting,Data Source,"Crash reports including summary  of dumps, exceptions, and hangs can indicate attempts at exploitation of  processes by malicious code or significant programing errors allowing  possible future exploitation or failure of business services."
DS024ApplicationServer,Data Source,"Application server logs,  considering the actual business application, middleware such as Tomcat, and  run time logs such as java runtime. contain a wealth of information created  when users and systems interact. Anomalies in the logs can indicate potential  failures or compromise attempts."
DS025IPAddressAssignment,Data Source,"The assignment of a new IP  address on the network indicates the precences of a new device. Software  solutions such as IPAM, DHCP, and VPN manage the temporary and long term  assignments of addresses and can be a rich source of information for asset  identification."
DS026WebApplicationFW,Data Source,"Web Application firewalls may  be present as a network application, cloud hosted solution or module loaded  in the web server. Using real time pattern matching the solution will detect  commodity attacks against web application and where possible identify or  prevent actual compromise."
DS027EndpointBackup,Data Source,Backup end restore activities  can an provide valuable insight into the activities of malware and malicious  internal users. In particular detection of destructive software via file  change or compromise of sensitive information via restoration to an alternate  location.
DS028NetworkDeviceAssociation,Data Source,Network device associate occurs  when a new device is attached to a wired or wireless lan. The association  process will record the mac address of the device connect regardless of the  network devices authentication. When correlated with DS025IPAddressAssignment  and DS003Authentication for device or network use rapid identification of an  asset owner is possible
DS029DatabaseServer,Data Source,Database Server logs and  metrics present utilization data which can be used to predict future capacity  and performance
DS030NetworkLoadBalancer,Data Source,A load balancer serves as the  single point of contact for clients. The load balancer distributes incoming  traffic across multiple targets. This increases the availability of your  application. You add one or more listeners to your load balancer.
DS031ApplicationLoadBalancer,Data Source,"An Application Load Balancer  functions at the application layer, the seventh layer of the Open Systems  Interconnection (OSI) model. After the load balancer receives a request, it  evaluates the listener rules in priority order to determine which rule to apply,  and then selects a target from the target group for the rule action. You can  configure listener rules to route requests to different target groups based  on the content of the application traffic. Routing is performed independently  for each"
DS032DNSGlobalLoadBalancer,Data Source,"GSLB works at the DNS level to  distribute requests.  Each datacenter  has its own GSLB server, and all of the servers broadcast an identical IP  address to the Internet.  Any request  for this IP address is automatically routed to the closest server via BGP.  That server then chooses where to direct the user depending on the designated  load-balancing ratio.  Once a site has  been chosen, the server responds to the user's request with the IP address of  the local load-balancing pool at that site."
DS033SystemLogs,Data Source,"Includes activities such as  service control, batch processing launch and other non security activities  logged by the host operating system."
DS034ApplicationLogs,Data Source,Internal logs produced by  custom or commercial applications used to monitor activity of interaction  with the application. Upstream errors impacting availability.
DS035NetworkFlow,Data Source,Network Flow data is distinct  from DS010NetworkCommunication as is not stateful individual events can be  generated for each direction of traffic flow and is generally sampled that is  an event is logged periodically for flow between the last event and current  time. As such it can not be used for detections such as number of  connections.
DS036ExternalAlert,Data Source,"External alerts or alarms are  generated by external monitoring solutions for example an external system  which may detect a brute force attack, distributed denial of service attach,  or simply a server running low on disk space. These alerts are not equivalent  to the original machine data or telemetry."
DS037WirelessIntrusion,Data Source,Sensor devices that detect  unknown access points and BSSIDs broadcasting within a customers immediate  area
