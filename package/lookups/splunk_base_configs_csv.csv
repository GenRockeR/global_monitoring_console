The location of the master and its pass4SymmKey must be provided. This app will be hand-carried to the indexer's $SPLUNK_HOME/apps.
In clustered environments, all searches are brokered by the cluster master (cf. org_cluster_search_base). This means that connecting directly to an indexer to perform a search is ill advised (and may get inconsistent results). Further, the configuration of a clustered indexer is managed by the master itself (apply cluster-bundle), so this is another reason to disable the Splunk UI."

The master's clustering configuration sets the default values for replication factor and search factor. The replication factor setting here couples with the 'repFactor = auto' setting on an index.

This app is expected to be layered on top of org_cluster_indexer_base; the settings there establish the general relationship with the master and set up clustered indexing behavior. This is another layer to provide the site number of the host, and to indicate that the clustering should be of the multi-site variety.
This app cannot be shipped via the master-apps mechanism; it would make all sites the same. Place it in apps on the affected indexer.  This can have a value ranging from site1..site63.  The numbers do *not* have to go in order, the first logical site can be site8, the second site12, all that matters is that the site number falls in the right range, and that when specific site names are used in the site_replication_factor of the master's config, there must be a valid match."
